taking a look at the WKInterfaceTimer

want to make a simple timer for boiling eggs. maybe add a start and stop
maybe add some quick adding intervals
maybe giving some way to input the number of seconds you want
i got ideas, man

help the masses with technology, what a nobel cause.
…with a timer. 

tiny steps

wanted to give a source for the inspiration to try this out

December 10th
starting to think that I can’t have two different tables on the same interface controller.
moreover I’m not sure if i am allowed to have tables inside groups. the table won’t scroll  inside the group, and if there are two separate tables in two groups the second label will not register even though i am 90% sure it is set up correctly. scanning the documentation I think I will have to define multiple row types; all in one table.
Not willing to muddle through this right now, maybe tonight or tommorow.
i am also have to rethink the layout, one screen for minutes and one for seconds. ugly.
